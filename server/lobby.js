// server/lobby.js — rooms, seats, host, AI seats, ready/start, reconnect, and room → Match wiring
// (DESIGN §2, §6.1 LOBBY, §8.1). Implements the handler interface consumed by server/net.js.
//
// Rules (the choices where DESIGN is silent are marked ▸):
//   * Rooms are keyed by 4-letter codes from an unambiguous alphabet (no I/O, letters only). Join codes are
//     case-insensitive.
//   * 'solo' rooms hold exactly one human and never bots. 'coop' rooms have MAX_SEATS seats (humans + AI bots).
//     Humans and bots take the lowest free seat index; seat indexes never compact.
//   * ▸ Being in a LOBBY room and sending room.create / room.join implicitly leaves it. While your room is
//     in a match, create/join of another room fails with ROOM_STARTED (send g.leave or room.leave first).
//   * Host-only: room.setDifficulty, room.addBot, room.removeBot, room.kick, room.start. ▸ Changing the difficulty
//     un-readies the other humans. ▸ room.start requires every other human to be connected and ready;
//     the host's start counts as the host's ready (the host may still toggle room.ready for display).
//   * room.kick {seat, playerId} (community report #17, owner approved): before the match only, the host removes another
//     human like an AI seat (an AI seat stays room.removeBot's; never the host itself). `playerId` names the player the
//     host confirmed: a seat that changed hands meanwhile (left, someone else joined) is refused with BAD_TARGET. The
//     seat is freed at once and the player gets `room.closed {reason:'kicked'}` — now, or on the next resume when
//     offline (with the result replay, as the grace timeout) —, so the reconnect token no longer leads back to the seat
//     (it stays the player's identity: net.js sessions belong to players, not seats). ▸ No ban: the player may join
//     again with the code.
//   * Host migration: when the host leaves (or is removed), the lowest-seat remaining human (connected
//     ones first) becomes host. A room without humans is disposed (bots never keep a room alive).
//   * Disconnect in LOBBY: the seat shows connected=false and is freed after `lobbyGraceMs` (60 s); a
//     session that comes back after that gets `room.closed {reason:'timeout'}`.
//     Disconnect in a match: the seat is kept and match.onDisconnect(playerId) is called.
//   * Reconnect: `hello` with a known token (reconnect window, 10 min, see net.js) rebinds the session;
//     the lobby then broadcasts room.state and, in a match, calls match.onReconnect(playerId).
//     Solo runs (下半: "休整期及机变阶段没有时间限制…24小时内随时返回", research 01 §1 / 06 §17): a session that drops
//     while its solo room's match runs stays resumable for the official `config.constants.singleReconnectTime`
//     (86400 s; option `soloReconnectWindowMs` overrides it) instead of the 10-minute window — the untimed solo match
//     simply waits (net.js session.resumeWindowMs, set at every disconnect). Only after that does expiry turn into
//     match.onLeave ('abandoned'). The extension outlives the match, so a run that ended meanwhile (e.g. a server-run
//     Final Assault) still shows its result on the player's return.
//     A repeated hello on a live connection is a full resync: room.state goes to the requester only
//     (broadcast only when the seat visibly changed, e.g. a rename in LOBBY); the heavy part (match.onReconnect,
//     or the result replay below) runs at most once per `resyncMinGapMs` per session — extra requests inside
//     that window coalesce into one deferred resync, so hello spam cannot amplify into ~15 KB per request.
//   * Result replay: the match's final m.public and each human's m.result are kept after the match ends. A
//     human who resyncs (resume after a drop, a reloaded tab, a repeated hello) while the room is back in LOBBY
//     gets room.state followed by those two frames again, until they act in the room (ready, difficulty, AI
//     seats, start), leave it, or a new match starts. A human removed by the lobby grace gets them right after
//     `room.closed {timeout}` on their next resume (Match.onReconnect cannot do this: the lobby drops the
//     match reference at onEnd and disposes it on the next macrotask).
//   * Per-network limits (internet clients only, see net.js clientAddress): at most `maxRoomsPerAddr` rooms
//     created from one network may exist at once and at most `maxMatchesPerAddr` matches started from one
//     network may run at once (room.create / room.start → ERR.RATE). Without them a socket loop could fill
//     `maxRooms` or keep hundreds of unattended matches simulating for the whole reconnect window.
//   * Permanent departure during a match (room.leave, g.leave, reconnect window expired): the seat is
//     marked departed (shown as connected=false), match.onLeave(playerId) is called, and the seat is freed
//     when the match ends. 'g.leave' is handled here and never reaches match.handle().
//   * All other 'g.*' messages go to room.match.handle(playerId, msg); its {ok}/{error} becomes the reply.
//   * Match lifecycle: room.start → new Match({...}) → room.state (inMatch=true) → match.start(). The match gets
//     `matchNo` = the room's match number (1, 2, …): with the seed it keeps battleIds unique across the room's
//     matches, so a late b.progress / b.result of the previous match is ignored by the next one (DESIGN §14).
//     onEnd(summary) → room back to LOBBY (departed seats freed, humans un-readied, disconnected humans
//     get the lobby grace), dispose() on the next macrotask. Players can start again.
//   * room.closed reasons: 'timeout' (removed after lobby grace), 'kicked' (room.kick, room.removeSpectator), 'empty' (a
//     spectator whose room lost its last player), 'shutdown' (server stopping).
//   * Operator loadout (DESIGN §16): room.loadout { entries } is checked strictly against the game data
//     (shared/protocol.js checkLoadout: known visible chess, a skill index legal for the normal AND the elite status, a
//     module of the elite or 'none'; any bad entry rejects the whole message, nothing is stored). ▸ It is stored on the
//     session (it follows the player into every room they create/join, and survives a resume) and on the seat; the
//     match receives seats[].loadout (bots: none — they fight with the defaults). ▸ Accepted any time: in a LOBBY room
//     (or outside a room) it simply replaces the stored one; while the room's match runs it is also handed to
//     match.setLoadout(playerId, loadout), which accepts it only during INFO_CHECK (the 干员调配 entry of the briefing)
//     and refuses it afterwards (WRONG_PHASE: the match's loadout is locked, the stored one applies to the next match).
//     ▸ Its `ops` (0.2.2: the per-operator 潜能 / 练度, shared/protocol.js checkLoadoutOps — an operator of the 干员调配
//     roster or the 自选 owned pool, strict like the entries) travel with it: session.ops / seat.ops / seats[].ops and
//     match.setLoadout(playerId, loadout, ops); a message without `ops` sets none (every operator 潜能 6, 精英2 Lv.60).
//   * Operator ownership (干员持有, 0.2.0 补位, owner's decision 2026-10-05): room.ownership { notOwned } — the base chess
//     ids the player marked as not owned — is checked leniently (shared/protocol.js checkNotOwned: anything that is not
//     a droppable NORMAL chess is dropped, never the whole list; only a malformed list is BAD_MSG) and stored on the
//     session and the seat like the loadout. The match receives seats[].notOwned when it starts (bots: none — they own
//     every operator) and keeps it for its whole length: the setting is out of match ("局外设置，下一局生效"), so while
//     the room's match runs a new list is only stored for the next match (ROOM_STARTED 'stored for the next match',
//     never handed to the match). A spectator's list stays on its session.
//   * 自选编队 (0.2.0 DIY, the owner's decisions of 2026-10-05): room.diy { picks } — the player's picks for the four DIY
//     slots ({ [slotBaseId]: { charId, skillIndex?, uniEquipId? } | null }) — is checked leniently (shared/protocol.js
//     checkDiyPicks against the game data and the kit registry, server/sim/content/kits/index.js KITTED_CHARS: an
//     illegal pick — an operator without a kit, another tier's prototype, a prototype off its locked skill, a second slot
//     of one owned operator, the same operator twice in a tier, an unknown slot / skill / module — is dropped, never the
//     whole roster; only malformed picks are BAD_MSG) and stored on the session and the seat exactly like the
//     not-owned list: the match receives seats[].diy when it starts (bots: none — they field no 自选 piece [ASSUMED]),
//     and a change while it runs is stored for the next match (ROOM_STARTED 'stored for the next match'). Every
//     `welcome` carries `diyKitted` (welcomeInfo): the operators a DIY slot may field, so the client's picker offers
//     exactly what the server accepts.
//   * Spectator seats (community report #26, owner's decision 2026-10-04 — a remake feature, the official room has none):
//     room.spectate { code } takes one of a co-op room's MAX_SPECTATORS (2) spectator seats, in its lobby or while its
//     match runs (▸ solo rooms: ROOM_FULL). A spectator is not a player: never in `seats`, never counted for the 1–6 players
//     or the start gate, never host, never keeps a room alive (a room whose last human leaves closes with room.closed
//     {empty} for its spectators). It receives room.state (`spectators: [{ playerId, name, connected }]`) and every match
//     broadcast (m.public, m.ticker, m.emote, b.pool — public data); the match registers it (opts.spectators /
//     addSpectator) and shows it fields like an eliminated player (b.start watch / m.field), never an m.private. It may
//     only g.watch (the heavy bucket, like every watcher), g.leave / room.leave, and room.loadout / room.ownership /
//     room.diy (stored for its session, never handed to the match); anything else → SPECTATOR (▸ emotes too). Host: room.removeSpectator { playerId } any
//     time → room.closed {kicked} to it. A spectator in a LOBBY room may take a free player seat with room.join of the same
//     code; a player never switches to spectating in place (ALREADY). Disconnect / grace / reconnect / expiry work as for
//     a player seat (the seat is kept and given back on resume).
